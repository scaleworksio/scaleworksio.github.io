Thom spoke about the various approaches to Continuous Delivery with
Chef at [ChefConf 2014](https://www.chef.io/chefconf/).

There are a large number of options in the Chef universe, ranging from
simple git checkouts, through to custom solutions using state of the
art Continuous Integration pipelines and push based scheduling.
Unfortunately, not all solutions are created equally, so Thom delved
deeper into the choices one could - and should - make.
